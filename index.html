          How did functions make your code more efficient? What would it have
          looked like if you didn’t use a function to make it more efficient?

          files to group related functions together?
        </h5>
        <p>
          I split my code up into multiple files and grouped related functions
          together, for example, all the functions that related to walls in my
          Mall_Maze program are grouped together. I also moved functions that

            Arrays: In my todo program, I used an array to store strings, which

            Arrays of Objects it efficiently work with Objects. For example, I
            intialized a blank array called wallArray and used push to add new
            Wall Objects.
          </li>
          <pre>
  wallArray = [];
            wallArray.push(new Wall(0, 50, 800, 10));

          How did you create your data structures? Did you initialize it with
          values? Did you use loops? Did you import from a file or an API? Etc.
          How are you reading/using the data stored in your data structure? Do
          you update/edit the data in your data structure?
        </h5>
        <p>
          For most of my arrays, I intialized a blank arrays and then pushed
          Objects or strings into them. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>

        >

        <h5>Do you remove elements from your data structure</h5>
        <p>
          I do remove elements from my data structure. For my todoarray, it is
          after a check box has been clicked.
        </p>
        <pre>
//Remove item if checkbox is clicked and re-draw
          function checkbox() {
            for (let i = 1; i < todoarray.length; i++) {
              let box = document.getElementById(`${i}box`);
              if (box.checked) {
                todoarray.splice(i, 1);
              }

            drawtodoarray();
          }</pre

        <p>
          However, with another of my programs, JS_Rainbow_Circles, I give users
          the option to clear the circleArray with the press of a button.
        </p>
        <pre>
          //Function deleteallCircle - Delete all the cirlces in the array

          What concepts, beyond the fundamental concepts, did you learn about
          and use in your portfolio programs?
        </h5>
        <p>
          I used Object-oriented programming (OOP) in my Wall_Maze and
          JS_Rainbow_Circles programs to store and work with large amounts of
          data/objects efficiently.

      <h3>
        Reflect on your Portfolio experience by answering the following
        questions...
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>What went well? / What did you enjoy?</li>
        <li>What was a challenge?</li>
        <li>What are a few things you learned?</li>
        <li>What would you do differently next time?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What I thought went well was genuinely doing the coding. At times I felt
        like I was going to cry because of how frustrated I was with things not
        working, but with a little bit of patience, I was able to figure things
        out. My favorite part of working on my portfolio was how much freedom I
        had to do things that I thought were interesting - I’m not going to lie,
        at least half the things in my portfolio are stuff that I literally
        thought was cool and latched on for a solid month or something. One
        thing I would do differently next though would be the amount of Game
        Development programs I work on. To be honest, Game Dev. is something I
        am super interested in, but because I fixated on something that didn’t
        have any use in game dev, I ended up doing a lot of Web Dev. projects.

      <h3>Self-Assessment</h3>

      <h4>Portfolio Programs: 100 / 100</h4>
      <p>
        I feel that my portfolio has a wide variety of programs that demonstrate
        my ability to apply these concepts. I also think that considering they
        are all original code that I planned myself, it is even more impressive
        that I was able to complete so many. Also, you can very clearly see what
        ideas I found interesting and wanted to explore over the months in my
        portfolio programs, which I find cool.
      </p>
      <h4>Apply Concepts: 100 / 100</h4>
      <p>
        I feel extremely confident in my ability to apply these concepts in the
        future and am pleased with my ability to apply them in present programs.
        I could have completed more projects including OOP, but seeing as that
        was an extended concept, I’m not too hung up over it.
      </p>
      <h4>Programming Confidence 90 / 100</h4>
      <p>
        I made a lot of stupid mistakes on tests and while programming, but I
        think that I was mostly able to figure out what went wrong and improve
        for the future. I feel confident in my abilities to implement these
        concepts in future projects.
      </p>
      <h4>Project Management: 100 / 100</h4>
      <p>
        Considering that one of the factors that affect the project management
        grade is work habits and attendance, which I feel I did good on. I
        stayed on task and completed the units in a timely matter, and according
        to Schoolzone, so far I have missed four classes - because I was sick.
        I’m not sure if my portfolio reflection satisfactorily answers the
        questions, but I am confident that. I think (?) my self-assessment is
        completed honestly.
